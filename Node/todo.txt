- Add clickable invisible buttons to play moves, then separate button for "Finish Turn"
  - Clicking a button should toggle showing the correct piece in the correct color
    - Do nothing if the resources aren't available
- Update players' resources after p2 goes
- Add some specific game state unit tests, using the screenshots Caitlin sent
  - Use these states later to make sure AI can find the right move
- GameState needs findValidMoves() function
  - Depending on resources, this will need to be called multiple times e.g. building a chain of roads
- Check with every new road if there are 1 or 2 subgraphs for a player
- Update should verify validity of a move
- When a space is overloaded, it shouldn't output resources to either player
- When a space is surrounded, it shouldn't output a resource to the other player, and this nullifies overloading
- Add move to trade 3-for-1, once per turn
- AI priorities
  - Pick random valid single move
  - Pick random valid move that uses up the most resources
  - Monte Carlo Tree Search
  - UCT or minimax or alpha/beta?
  - TBD
